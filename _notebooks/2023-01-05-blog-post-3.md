I'm excited to share the highlights of the "XR Talks" event that I've been diligently working on. The event took place on June 6th at the Manufacture Campus within the Université Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne.

The enthusiasm surrounding this event is palpable, particularly due to the exceptional lineup of speakers we were fortunate to have.

Reflecting on this remarkable event centered on XR and Innovation, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment. Throughout the day, attendees were treated to a wealth of valuable insights, an abundance of inspiration, and an atmosphere of collaboration.

My heartfelt gratitude extends to the remarkable speakers who generously volunteered their time and shared their expertise with our eager audience.

Blandine Masselin, an instructional engineer at the University of Bordeaux, captivated us with her insights into "Designing Effective VR Experiences for Learning" from an instructional designer's perspective. Drawing from her expertise in both in-person and online learning, she shed light on active teaching methods and pedagogical tools.

Alex Frêne, the XR Developer and Founder of Otter Tech Studio, shared his wealth of experience dating back to 2012 in real-time experiences and VR since 2014. Alex's passion for immersive technologies shone through as he delved into the intricacies of "XR Development Workflow," providing a deeper understanding of the creative process behind XR development.

François Voron, a seasoned CTO & Open-Source Maintainer, mesmerized the audience with his journey from a programmer to an entrepreneur. He shared hard truths and invaluable lessons from his experiences, taking us through the fascinating story of ProTournoi, the startup he co-founded during his Master's Degree.

Mamadi Dioubate, a Unity Lead Developer and virtual reality enthusiast, discussed "XR Development Tools and Career Opportunities." With over five years of expertise in creating extended reality applications, Mamadi provided invaluable insights into the world of XR development tools and the exciting career paths within the field.

I'd like to extend my sincere appreciation to the IMLEX Erasmus Mundus Japan staff at UJM, particularly Prof. Philippe Colantoni and Crane ROGERS, for their unwavering support in bringing this event to fruition.

A heartfelt thank you is also due to all the attendees whose active participation contributed to the success of the event. The open session that concluded the event sparked engaging discussions about the future of XR, considerations in game engine choices, fostering innovation, and nurturing creativity.
