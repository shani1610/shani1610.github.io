I am a Computer Science master's graduate from the [IMLEX - Erasmus Mundus Japan program](https://imlex.org/), specializing in **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning**. I completed my thesis on Generative AI at the [VisualAI lab](https://val.cs.tut.ac.jp/) under the supervision of [Kuriyama-Sensei](https://www.tut.ac.jp/english/schools/faculty/cs/164.html) at Toyohashi University of Technology, Japan.

Previously, I worked at [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/) as an **Algorithm and System Engineer**, focusing on signal processing. I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Technion – Israel Institute of Technology](https://ece.technion.ac.il/).

I am passionate about advancing Computer Vision and its applications in solving real-world challenges. Let’s connect if you share similar interests!
