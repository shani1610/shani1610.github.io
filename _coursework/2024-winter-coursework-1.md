This repository contains the results of practical works for 3D Vision Computation class, lectured by Professor Yasuyuki Sugaya. 
This course introduces camera calibration methods and AR applications with various markers, including a
famous AR marker, a circular marker, and natural points and lines features. 

In this assignment I develop an AR application based on the studied knowledge and discuss the performance of it.

to execute run these: 

```python .\sample\core.py```
