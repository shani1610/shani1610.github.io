I want to take a moment to reflect on the incredible XR and Innovation event we recently hosted. It was a day filled with valuable insights, inspiration, and collaboration.

I extend my gratitude to the exceptional speakers for generously volunteering their time and sharing their expertise with us.
Blandine Masselin enlightened us about designing effective VR experiences for learning, while Alex Frêne provided a deeper understanding of XR development workflow. François Voron shared his inspiring journey from programmer to entrepreneur, and Mamadi DIOUBATE discussed XR development tools and exciting career opportunities.
Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to the IMLEX Erasmus Mundus Japan staff at UJM, especially Prof. Philippe Colantoni and Crane ROGERS invaluable support in bringing this event to life.
I would also like to thank all the attendees who actively participated and contributed to the event's success. The open session at the end sparked insightful discussions on the future of XR, considerations in game engine choices, innovation, and ways to foster creativity.

Stay tuned for future events, next time in TUT, Japan, as we continue our journey in the world of XR!
