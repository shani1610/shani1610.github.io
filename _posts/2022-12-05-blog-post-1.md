During my master's studies in Finland, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in a vibrant and unique cultural environment. One aspect that particularly captivated me was the significance of libraries in Finnish lifestyle. At the University of Eastern Finland, the library stood out with its beautiful, expansive windows, allowing us to enjoy the serene view of snowfall outside while nestled in a cozy and inspiring space.

The library offered a diverse range of seating options, catering to various study preferences and needs. Whether you needed a room for group work, a quiet hallway for self-study, access to computers, or simply a comfortable private couch, the library had it all. However, what truly enchanted me was not just the university library but the city library as well. It served as a hub for the community, with spacious hallways filled with magazines, colorful reading areas for kids (not just Moomin adventures!), and spaces for watching movies or listening to music. Moreover, the library offered not just books but also opportunities to borrow a wide array of resources for personal and creative endeavors.

In Helsinki, the modern Oddi library redefined the concept of a library, offering an incredible array of services. From free conference room bookings to access to 3D printers, sewing machines, and VR rooms, the library seemed to cater to every imaginable interest. My friend and I found ourselves sitting on a wooden hill at the library book section, savoring the atmosphere and camaraderie of like-minded individuals gathered in this exceptional space.

Another aspect that pleasantly surprised me during my time in Finland was the university cafeterias. Having had some less-than-stellar experiences in military cafeterias, I was initially apprehensive. However, the Finnish university cafeterias turned out to be a pleasant surprise. They not only offered affordable and delicious meals (with a vegetarian option priced as low as 1.60 euros) but also provided a range of choices, including various salads, carbohydrates, and protein sources. It was a convenient and budget-friendly solution for a student like me, alleviating the hassle of cooking daily.

The changing seasons in Finland were a breathtaking experience in itself. From the lush greenery of summer to the enchanting golden hues of autumn adorned with mushrooms and finally, the serene beauty of winter with its pure white landscapes, I relished the distinct charm each season brought. My stay from late August to mid-December allowed me to witness this mesmerizing transformation.

The bike roadways in Finland also left a lasting impression on me. The well-designed bike lanes, separate from the car roads, created a safe and enjoyable biking experience. Riding the bikes through the well-lit and flat roads allowed me to truly connect with the surroundings. I loved watching squirrels play, passing by the local market at the center while heading to the university, and feeling the rhythm of life outside the academic bubble.

Before my arrival, I had heard that Finnish people might be reserved and introverted, making it challenging to form friendships. However, my personal experience couldn't have been more different. I found the people in Finland to be incredibly kind, warm, and friendly. Making connections and forging friendships was a heartwarming and enriching experience.

Studying in Finland has left an indelible mark on me, both academically and culturally. I cherish the memories of libraries that fostered creativity, cafeterias that nourished both body and soul, and the genuine warmth of the Finnish people. It was truly a transformative journey that I will carry with me for a lifetime.
