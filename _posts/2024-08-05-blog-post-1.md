# Case Study: Near-Hand Effect in VR

During the class study, we engaged in psychophysical experiments utilizing VR environments in both experimenter and participant roles. This section aims to briefly outline the experimental methods, environment, procedures, and statistical tests employed in this study.

## Background

The visual system processes information using different pathways. Two main pathways, the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P), handle distinct aspects like spatial frequencies and color. M cells excel in high temporal frequencies, while P cells are better with high spatial frequencies and color. Recent studies highlight the hands' special role in guiding vision, known as the Near-Hand Effect (NHE). This effect suggests that one's hands can influence attention and perception for nearby items, connecting with the visual system's sensitivity to high-frequency stimuli (Edwards, 2021).

In (Abrams R. A., 2015), the authors review several different but interrelated domains of research that have approached questions about the role of the hands from somewhat distinct perspectives. The Near-Hand Effect (NHE) suggests that one's hands can influence attention and perception for nearby items, connecting with the visual system's sensitivity to high-frequency stimuli.

Researchers have recently reported changes in the performance of a number of tasks that depend on the proximity of the hands to the stimuli being evaluated. Objects near the hands are thought to receive preferential visual processing because such objects are important—they might be candidates for action, or they could be dangerous obstacles that should be avoided.

Thus, the effects are thought to reflect the important ways in which the capabilities or vulnerabilities of our bodies can affect perceptual and cognitive processes. In a study presented in (Abrams R. A., 2014), the authors explored changes in early vision near the hands. Participants were more sensitive to low-spatial-frequency information and less sensitive to high spatial-frequency information for stimuli presented close to the hands. The two postures used in the experiments in (Abrams R. A., 2014) are shown in Figure 2. In the hands-near blocks, participants placed their hands on 6-cm-diameter buttons attached to each side of the monitor, with their elbows resting on foam cushions. In hands-far blocks, participants placed their hands on the same two buttons resting on a board on their lap.

All of the stimuli were presented on a gray background. Each trial began with the presentation of a white fixation spot, followed by the presentation of a Gabor patch tilted to the left or right of fixation. Gabor patch is the typical building block of the visual stimulus in the field of visual neuroscience, which efficiently activates and matches the shape of receptive fields in the visual cortex. Gabor patches used in different configurations, with different levels of spatial frequency, contrast, orientation, spatial location, distance, and displacement. Example in Figure 3. In the experiment, The Gabor patch consisted of a sine-wave grating with a spatial frequency. The grating was either vertical or tilted in 4° to the left or right of vertical. the participant’s task was to indicate whether the grating was vertical or tilted, and to press the correct one of the two keys to indicate their judgment.

In Figure 4 we see mean sensitivities from the experiment conducted in (Abrams R. A., 2014), as a function of spatial frequency, separately for the two hand postures. The dashed line is from the hands-near condition. Error bars show the within-subjects standard errors.

They found an advantage near the hands for discriminating low-spatial-frequency stimuli. Our class research question is centered on whether the near-hand effect manifests in the virtual space. The hypothesis posits that this effect will indeed occur in the VR environment, suggesting an advantage in discriminating low-spatial-frequency stimuli when near the hands.

## Method

The two postures used in the experiments in are shown in Figure 5. In the hands-near blocks, participants placed their hands on the sides of the display in VR space, with their elbows resting on foam cushions. In hands-far blocks, participants placed their hands resting on the side of their thigh.

All of the stimuli were presented on a gray background. Each trial began with the presentation of a Gabor patch. The stimuli are shown in Figure 6.

The participant’s task was to indicate whether the grating was vertical or tilted, and to pull the VR hand controller on the correct one to indicate their judgment. There are 128 trials per one participant as indicated in Equation 1. The trials are indicated in Figure 7.

\[2 (\text{Near/Far}) \times 2 (\text{frequency low/high}) \times 2 (\text{tilted/vertical}) \times 2 (\text{tilted left/right}) \times 2 (\text{position left/right}) \times 2 (\text{repeat}) \times 2 (\text{block}) = 4 \times 8 \times 4 = 128\ \text{trials}\]

The experiment unfolds in three phases: 'Explanation,' 'Coordination,' and 'Task.'

- **Explanation Phase:** Participants are introduced to the experiment and make necessary adjustments to their positions and the 3D model. Instructions are displayed on the HMD, and participants proceed by pulling a trigger. They receive an explanation of the task and respond to the initial response assignment regarding the Gabor stimulus.

- **Coordination Phase:** During this phase, adjustments are made to stimulus presentation and hand positioning in the UP condition. Participants fine-tune the model's hand based on displayed blue bar objects. The bar’s color changes from blue to red, signals successful adjustments, shown in Figure 8: Diagram of the coordination phase. Taken from class slides.

  pulling the trigger transitions to the 'Task Phase.'

- **Task Phase:** The core of the experiment begins. Participants recalibrate the HMD position and follow instructions for hand movements (UP/DOWN) as shown in Figure 9. The model's hand is adjusted, and a white solid viewpoint appears on the screen. Gabor stimuli are presented on either side, followed by a response prompt. Participants use the left or right triggers to indicate whether the Gabor stimulus is tilted.

# Results, Analysis and Discussion

In this section, I will consolidate the experiment's results, offering an analysis, discussion, findings, and concluding with areas for improvement and comments.

## Analytical Tools

In the data analysis part, R with RStudio was used, and the following factors were taken into account during the analysis:

- Quantitative indexes (specifically, sensitivity and bias) based on signal detection theory
- A Two-way ANOVA statistical test

The collected data exhibits a non-parametric distribution. Non-parametric statistics do not make assumptions about a particular distribution in the underlying population. Consequently, these methods are considered distribution-free, as they impose fewer assumptions about the data.

## Signal Detection Theory (SDT)

SDT is a framework widely used for analyzing and quantifying the ability to differentiate between signal and noise in decision-making. Key concepts include:

- Signal: The presented stimulus, such as a tone in an experiment.
- Noise: Other stimuli in the environment that might be confused for the signal.
- Decision-criteria: Setting thresholds to determine the presence or absence of a signal.
- Sensitivity (A’): The ability to distinguish between signal and noise, with higher A’ indicating better discrimination.
- Response Bias (B’ ’D): The tendency to respond in a specific way (strategy), influencing decision-making.
- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve: A visual representation of the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

**Figure 10: (a) Sensitivity, (b) Bias. Taken from class slides.**

![Sensitivity and Bias](link_to_image)

In SDT, detection outcomes include hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections, as shown in Table 1:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& \text{YES (Tilted)} & \text{NO (Vertical)} \\
\hline
\text{Tilted} & \text{Hit} & \text{Miss} \\
\text{Vertical} & \text{False alarm} & \text{Correct rejection} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

**Table 1: hit, miss, false alarm and correct rejection**

For analysis, we use quantitative indexes: Sensitivity (A’) and Bias (B’ ’D) due to the non-parametric distribution of the data. Sensitivity reflects the ability to identify stimuli correctly, while Bias indicates a systematic tendency in classification. To assess statistical differences between means, a Two-way ANOVA test was conducted.

## ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) expands on the t-test by assessing if two or more population means are equal. The t-test is a statistical method used to compare the means of two groups and determine if they are significantly different from each other. If there’s a large difference in the means and spread of the variance results in no overlap, we can say that two populations are statistically different from each other. It assesses whether the observed differences between the groups are likely due to actual differences in the populations or if they could occur by chance. The t-test helps researchers understand if there's a meaningful distinction between two sets of data, considering the variability within each group. It's useful for analyzing the impact of qualitative variables on a quantitative outcome. T-test compares two populations and ANOVA for 3 groups or more. Both convert their statistics into p-value, an index measuring the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. The P stands for probability and measures how likely it is that any observed difference between groups is due to chance. Being a probability, P can take any value between 0 and 1. Values close to 0 indicate that the observed difference is unlikely to be due to chance, whereas a P value close to 1 suggests no difference between the groups other than due to chance (Dahiru, 2008). There are two types of ANOVA, One-way ANOVA involves one independent variable, assessing its impact on the dependent variable, and Two-way ANOVA which involves two independent variables, evaluating their individual and interactive effects on the dependent variable. We will do two-way ANOVA.

## Results and Analysis

We used the results from the csv file in R with RStudio and we used packages like: ggpubr, plyr, dplyr, ratatix, psycho, RColorBrewer, and tidyr. The cvs input was processed so we could do a statistical analysis and visualization. As shown before, we used as the quantitative indexes the Sensitivity = A’ and Bias = B’’D because the data show non-parametric distribution. These were computed based on the signal detection theory. Aprime (A’) is a non-parametric estimate of discriminability. An A’ near 1.0 indicates good discriminability. While a value near 0.5 means chance performance. Bppd (B””D) is a non-parametric estimate of bias. A B”D equal to 0.0 indicates no bias. Positive numbers represent conservative bias (i.e., a tendency to answer ‘no’). Negative numbers represent liberal bias (i.e. a tendency to answer ‘yes’). The maximum absolute value is 1.0. The outcomes of the A' and B"D tests, as well as the two-way ANOVA test for each of them, are displayed in Figure 11 and Table 2.

## Discussion

The examination of sensitivity in participants revealed intriguing insights depicted in Figure 11 (a). The A’ values, indicating discriminability, trended higher for high spatial frequency stimuli. The mean sensitivity appeared slightly elevated for far-hand positions, but this warranted validation through a two-way ANOVA. Table 2 (a) presents the ANOVA table, revealing a significant effect in the Frequency of the stimuli factor (p < 0.05). The near-hand and far-hand effects showed no statistical difference.

Bias evaluation, illustrated in Figure 11 (b), suggested a conservative response tendency among participants. ANOVA results (Table 2 (b)) yielded non-significant effects for Hand position, Frequency of stimuli, and their interaction. Sensitivity was higher for high-frequency stimuli, while no significant differences arose from the near-hand and far-hand positions or their interaction. The F-ratio and p-s values supported a substantial effect size in the frequency of stimuli factor.

Contrary to expectations, the experiment in VR did not exhibit sensitivity differences. The anticipated heightened sensitivity to low-frequency stimuli near the hands was not supported. Immersion in the virtual environment likely canceled the expected effects, challenging the assumption that proximal stimuli receive preferential visual processing. The lack of visibility of hands in the VR space reduced the near-hand effect, highlighting the brain's adaptation to virtual scenarios. The magnocellular pathway, presumed to favor near-hand stimuli, did not manifest as anticipated. The near-hand effect vanished in VR, emphasizing the decreased influence of motor sensory inputs in an immersive virtual setting. Despite participants exhibiting sensitivity to high-frequency stimuli, the near-hand effect's absence emphasizes the complexity of visual processing in VR.

More research is needed to understand if the parvocellular pathway is more dominant in virtual reality, and this needs to be supported by actual evidence. In conclusion, our experiment in VR reveals unexpected details in sensory processing. The absence of the near-hand effect challenges prior assumptions, underscoring the intricacies of perceptual adaptation in immersive virtual spaces. While sensitivity to high-frequency stimuli persisted, the interplay between spatial frequency, hand position, and VR immersion demands further investigation for a comprehensive understanding of visual processing dynamics.

## Improvements

During the course of the experiment, certain challenges and opportunities for enhancement were identified:

### Hand Position Challenges:

Participants faced difficulties maintaining the correct hand position in the VR environment, particularly when transitioning from a far to a near-hand position. The instances of uncomfortable sitting positions prompted hurried responses, potentially introducing errors. A suggested improvement involves enhancing the code to dynamically provide instructions in the VR environment, ensuring accurate hand placement during trials.

### Hypothesis on Sensitivity to Visual Stimuli:

The initial hypothesis, positing higher sensitivity to low-frequency visual stimuli in VR, was disproven. The immersiveness of VR, where the hands are not visible, may have rendered the hand presence irrelevant to the brain. An intriguing avenue for exploration involves visualizing the subject's hands in the VR setup to test if this influences sensitivity, potentially aligning with the initial hypothesis.
